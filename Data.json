  {
    "Question": "What are the possible Symptoms and Signs for a heart attack",
    "Answer": "Fatigue,Chest discomfort,Malaise, Typical chest pain in acute MI has the following characteristics:\n\nIntense and unremitting for 30-60 minutes\n\nSubsternal, and often radiates up to the neck, shoulder, and jaw, and down the left arm\n\nUsually described as a substernal pressure sensation that also may be characterized as squeezing, aching, burning, or even sharp"
  },
  {
    "Question": "How long does it take for the signs and symptoms to show up?",
    "Answer": "Patients with typical MI will begin to suffer symptoms in the days or even weeks preceding the event (although typical STEMI may occur suddenly, without warning"
  },
  {
    "Question": "What Lab test are usually used to determine if the patient has a Heart attack",
    "Answer": "Cardiac biomarkers/enzymes,Troponin levels and Complete blood cell count"
  },
  {
    "Question": "why do we use test to determine if the patients had a heart attack ?",
    "Answer": "The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines recommend that cardiac biomarkers should be measured at presentation in patients with suspected MI, and that the only biomarker that is recommended to be used for the diagnosis of acute MI at this time is cardiac troponin due to its superior sensitivity and accuracy"
  },
  {
    "Question": "What is Electrocardiography?",
    "Answer": "An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)�records the electrical signal from the heart to check for different heart conditions. Electrodes are placed on the chest to record the heart's electrical signals, which cause the heart to beat. The signals are shown as waves on an attached computer monitor or printer."

    "Question": "How do we usually Diagnos if a patients has a Myocardial infarction ?",
    "Answer": "Lab Tests,Electrocardiography,Cardiac imaging"
  },
  {
    "Question": "What are some of the common reasons for getting a Myocardial Infarction?",
    "Answer": "Myocardial infarction (MI) usually results from an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand, which is most often caused by plaque rupture with thrombus formation in an epicardial coronary artery, resulting in an acute reduction of blood supply to a portion of the myocardium."
  },
  {
    "Question": "What are the Types of MI",
    "Answer": "Type 1 (spontaneous MI),Type 2 (MI secondary to an ischemic imbalance),Type 3(MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable),Type 4a (MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]), Type 4b (MI related to stent thrombosis) and Type 5 (MI related to coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG])"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 1 of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type1 (spontaneous MI)Related to atherosclerotic plaque rupture, ulceration, fissuring, erosion, or dissection with intraluminal thrombus in one or more of the coronary arteries, leading to decreased myocardial blood flow or distal platelet emboli and thereby resulting in myocyte necrosis. The patient may or may not have underlying obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD)"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 2 of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type 2 (MI secondary to an ischemic imbalance):�MI consequent to increased oxygen demand or a decreased supply (eg, coronary endothelial dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, coronary artery"
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 3 of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type 3 (MI resulting in death when biomarker values are unavailable):�Sudden, unexpected cardiac death before blood samples for biomarkers could be drawn or before their appearance in the circulation."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 4a of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type 4a (MI related to percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]):�Elevation of biomarker values (cTn is preferred) to more than 5 times the 99�th�percentile of the URL in patients with normal baseline values (< 99�th�percentile URL)�or�a rise of values over 20% if the baseline values are elevated but stable or falling."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 4b of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type 4b (MI related to stent thrombosis):�MI associated with stent thrombosis as detected by coronary angiography or autopsy in the setting of myocardial ischemia in combination with a rise�and/or�fall of cardiac biomarkers with at least one value above the 99�th�percentile URL."
  },
  {
    "Question": "Describe Type 5 of Myocardial Infarction",
    "Answer": "Type 5 (MI related to coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG]):�Elevation�of cardiac biomarker values more than 10 times the 99�th�percentile URL in patients with normal baseline cTn values"

    "Answer": "Fat in food and fat stored in the body is in the form of triglycerides. A triglyceride is a substance that is composed of three fatty acids attached to a single glycerol molecule. Triglycerides are carried in the blood bound to proteins forming high- and lowdensity lipoproteins. Like cholesterol, triglyceride in the blood comes either from the diet or from its synthesis in the liver. High triglyceride levels are associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke"

  {
    "Question": "Is a low fat diet the best approach to reduce heart disease risk?",
    "Answer": "Current dietary recommendations in the UK advise that the population average fat intake should be reduced to 35% of energy, a level that has more 296 Cardiovascular Disease or-less been achieved, and that intake of saturates should be reduced to 11% of energy, and n-6 polyunsaturates increased to 6.5% of energy. In the past, other countries have adopted even lower targets for total fat (e.g. 30% of energy) and for saturates. This strategy is primarily aimed at reducing LDLcholesterol levels. In recent years, however, evidence has accumulated about the potential of low fat/high carbohydrate diets to adversely affect other blood lipid markers (e.g. triglycerides and small, dense LDL particles), and on the potential benefits of other families of fatty acids on other cardiovascular risk factors, particularly insulin resistance. This evidence points to the need for more attention to be paid to the positive attributes of the long chain n-3 fatty acid found in oil-rich fish and to monounsaturates (as found in olive oil and rapeseed oil, for example). In order to include such fatty acids in adequate amounts, some experts have argued strongly for a more flexible approach to total fat recommendations, especially for subjects with the insulin resistance syndrome (syndrome X). But the answer is not yet clear cut and more evidence is needed before conclusions can be drawn (see Chapter 11, Sections 11.6�11.8). What is known, however, is that regular moderate intensity physical activity can counteract the impact of a low fat diet on increased triglycerides levels, as can inclusion in the diet of long chain n-3 fatty acids present in oil-rich fish (see Chapter 13). 16.13 Physical activity Q88. How much physical activity should we be doing? It seems that there is no threshold for the minimal amount of exercise necessary to decrease cardiovascular risk, and that any increase in daily energy expenditure is beneficial. However, to gain real benefit, adults (including older adults) should take at least 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity activity on five or more days each week. Moderate intensity activity should lead to an increase in breathing rate, an increase in heart rate and to a feeling of increased warmth, possibly accompanied by sweating. The good news is that shorter bouts of activity can be accumulated during the day and still count towards the 30-minute minimum. Children and young people should achieve a total of at least 60 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity each day"
